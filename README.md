# unix-project
Final project for Unix F24:
The goal of this project is to create a media player system on a Raspberry Pi that
streams Netflix through Kodi. When the user closes the Netflix session in Kodi, the
Raspberry Pi captures data about the watched content and sends it to a
Python-based machine learning script. This script uses a pre-trained
recommendation model to generate personalized movie recommendations based on
the user's viewing history. The recommendations are then sent to the user's email.
This will be done thanks to lessons we've learned throughout the semester and each week,
there will be a journal that contains the progress that will be made.
